# The golden pair: sample design and estimator

Accounting for the sampling design is crucial for analyzing complex survey data. We must ensure that PSU, strata, and weights are available in the survey dataset to enable adequate analysis. Alternatively, when such information is not available, the dataset should at least contain replicate weights, or the analyst should have clear guidance on how to compute both point and variance estimates. 

A well-described survey design facilitates statistical analysis, supports effective data interpretation, and enables meaningful insights into complex phenomena. Missing or incorrect design information may lead to biased estimates and misleading conclusions.

## Parameters and estimators

Under a design-based approach this section presents the basic principles of inductive inference and how, using the *sampling weights* (from chapter VIII), one can get consistent estimators for population parameters of interest. We adopt the notation introduced in chapter VIII for presenting the expressions required here.

The *population total* $Y = \sum _{U} y_k$ and *mean* $\overline Y = \frac Y N$ of a survey variable $y$ can be estimated by weighted estimators given by $\widehat Y _{HT} = \sum _{s} d_k \ y_k$ and $\overline y_{H} = \frac {\widehat Y_{HT}} {\widehat N_{HT}} = \frac {\sum_{s} d_k \ y_k} {\sum_{s} d_k}$, respectively. When the survey weights are calibrated and/or non-response adjusted, the above expressions may still be used, but with the calibrated or non-response adjusted weights, $w_k$ say, replacing the design weights $d_k$, for all $k \in s$. 

Here $s = \left\{ k_1, \ldots, k_n \right\} \subset U$ denotes the set of units in a sample selected from the population $U$ using a *probability sampling design* $p(s)$, that ensures strictly positive first order inclusion probabilities $\pi_k = Pr(k \in s), \, \forall \, k \in U$. These inclusion probabilities are assumed known $\forall \, k \in s$, at least to the data producers. 

Under the design-based framework and assuming full response, $\widehat Y _{HT}$ is unbiased for $Y$ and its sampling variance is given by

$$
V_p \left( \widehat{Y}_{HT} \right) = \sum_{k \in U} \sum_{j \in U} \left( \frac {d_k d_j} {d_{kj}} - 1 \right) y_k y_j
$$

where $d_{kj} = 1 / \pi_{kj}$ and $\pi_{kj} = Pr(k,j \in s), \, \forall \, k,j \in U$. This result assumes that the sampling design $p(s)$ is such that $\pi_{kj} > 0 \,\, \forall \, k,j \in U$.

Under full response, this variance can be estimated unbiasedly by

$$
\widehat {V_p} \left( \widehat{Y}_{HT} \right) = \sum_{k \in s} \sum_{j \in s} \left( d_k d_j - d_{kj} \right) y_k y_j
$$

While the above formula for variance estimation is general and covers the vast majority of sample designs used in the practice of household sample surveys, it is not used in practice because the second order inclusion probabilities $\pi_{kj}$ (and corresponding pairwise weights $d_{kj}$) are generally unknown to survey data analysts. In fact, even data producers do not compute such pairwise weights, since there are more efficient methods for variance estimation that do not require having such weights.

## Uncertainty in household surveys

As the sample is typically a small subset of the population, it is important to obtain not only point estimates for the parameters of interest, but also the corresponding uncertainty measures and/or confidence intervals. In this subsection we present some approaches for variance estimation: approximate formulas from *Taylor linearization* and/or the *ultimate cluster* approach for variances under multi-stage cluster sampling. We also introduce replication methods and generalized variance functions, which are essential when PSU or strata are missing from the sample dataset.

A unifying idea of sampling theory is that of estimating equations - @Binder1983. Many population parameters can be written/obtained as solutions for *population estimating equations*. A generic population estimating equation is given by $\sum_{i \in U} z_i (\theta) = 0 $, where $z_i(\bullet)$ is an *estimating function* evaluated for unit $i$ and $\theta$ is a population parameter of interest.

For the case of the population total, take $z_i(\theta) = y_i - \theta / N$. The corresponding population estimation equation is given by $\sum _{i \in U} (y_i - \theta / N) = 0$, and solving for $\theta$ gives the population total $\theta_U = \sum _{i \in U} y_i \ = \ Y$. Similarly, take $z_i(\theta) = y_i - \theta$ for the population mean. As a final example, consider the ratio of population totals. Taking $z_i(\theta) = y_i - \theta x_i$, the corresponding population estimation equation is given by $\sum _{i \in U} (y_i - \theta x_i) = 0$. Solving for $\theta$ gives the *population ratio* $\theta_U = \sum _{i \in U} y_i / \sum _{i \in U} x_i \ = \ R$.

The idea of defining population parameters as solutions to population estimating equations allows defining a general method for obtaining corresponding sample estimators. It is a matter of using the *sample estimating equations* $\sum _{k \in s} d_k \, z_k (\theta) = 0$. Under *probability sampling*, full response and with $d_k = 1 / \pi_k$, the sample sum in the left hand side is unbiased towards the population sum in the corresponding population estimating equation. Solving the sample estimating equation yields consistent estimators for the corresponding population parameters.

The case of the population mean yields the sample estimating equation $\sum _{k \in s} d_k (y_k - \theta) = 0$, and by solving on $\theta$, we recover the HÃ jek estimator $\widehat \theta = \sum _{k \in s} d_k \, y_k \, / \sum _{k \in s} d_k = \overline y_H$. In the case of the population ratio, solving $\sum _{k \in s} d_k (y_k - \theta x_k) = 0$ on $\theta$, yields the well-known estimator $\widehat \theta = \sum _{k \in s} d_k \, y_k \, / \sum _{k \in s} d_k \, x_k = \widehat R$.

The variance of estimators obtained as solutions of sample estimating equations can be obtained as:

$$
V_p (\widehat \theta) \doteq \left[ J (\theta_U) \right] ^{-1} V_p \left[ \sum _{k \in s} d_k \, z_k (\theta_U) \right] \left[ J (\theta_U) \right] ^{-1}
$$

where $J (\theta_U) = \sum _{k \in U} \left[ \partial{z_k (\theta)} / \partial \theta \right]_{\theta = \theta_U}$, and $\theta_U$ is the solution of the corresponding population estimating equation.

A consistent estimator of this variance is given by:

$$
\widehat V_p (\widehat \theta) = \left[ \widehat J ( \widehat \theta) \right] ^{-1} \widehat V_p \left[ \sum _{k \in s} d_k \, z_k (\widehat \theta)\right] \left[ \widehat J ( \widehat \theta) \right] ^{-1}
$$

where $\widehat J (\widehat \theta) = \sum _{k \in s} d_i \, \left[ \partial{z_k ( \theta)} / \partial \theta \right]_{\theta = \widehat \theta}$.

This approach implies that by one is able to estimate many population parameters and corresponding variances using essentially well known methods for estimating totals. Its simplicity and generality have enabled the development of software such as the `R survey` package, the `Stata svy` functions and others. 

## Ultimate Cluster Method

The central idea of the *Ultimate Cluster* method for variance estimation for estimators of totals in multi-stage cluster sampling designs, proposed by [@Hansen1953], is to consider only the variation between information available in the level of PSUs, and assume that these would have been selected with replacement from the PSU population. This idea is simple, but quite powerful, because it allows to accommodate a variety of sampling designs, involving stratification and selection with unequal probabilities (with or without replacement) of both PSUs as well as lower level sampling units. The requirements for the application of this method are that one has unbiased estimators of totals for the variable of interest for each sampled PSU, and that data are available for at least two sampled PSUs in each stratum (if the sample is stratified in the first stage).

Although the method was originally proposed for estimation of variances of estimated totals, it can also be applied in combination with Taylor linearization to obtain variance estimates for estimators of other population quantities that can be obtained as solutions to sample estimating equations. 

Consider a multi-stage sampling design, in which $m_{h}$ PSUs are selected in stratum $h,$ $h=1,\ldots ,H$. Let $\pi_{hi}$ be the inclusion probability of PSU $i$ stratum $h$, and by $\widehat{Y}_{hi}$ an unbiased estimator of the total $Y_{hi}$ of the survey variable $y$ for the $i$-th PSU in stratum $h$, $h=1,\ldots ,H$. Hence an unbiased estimator of the population total $Y = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{i \in U_{1h}} Y_{hi}$ is given by $\widehat{Y}_{UC} = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{i \in s_{1h}} d_{hi} \widehat{Y}_{hi}$, and the *ultimate cluster* estimator of the corresponding variance is given by:

$$
\widehat{V}_{UC} \left( \widehat{Y}_{UC}\right) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \frac{m_{h}}
{m_{h}-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{h}} \left( d_{hi} \widehat{Y}_{hi} - \frac{\widehat{Y}_{h}}{m_{h}} \right) ^{2}
$$

where $U_{1h}$ and $s_{1h}$ are the population and sample sets of PSUs in stratum $h$, $d_{hi} = 1 / \pi_{hi}$, $\widehat{Y}_{h} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_{h}} d_{hi} \widehat{Y}_{hi}$ for $h=1,\ldots ,H$. (See for example, [@Shah1993], p. 4).

Although often the selection of primary units can have Primary Cluster estimator presented here may provide a reasonable approximation of the corresponding variance of randomization. This is because sampling plans without replacement are generally more efficient than plans with replacement of equal size. Such an approximation is widely used by sampling practitioners to estimate variances of usual descriptive quantities such as totals and medium (with due adaptation) due to their simplicity, compared to the much greater complexity involved with the employment of variance estimators that attempt to incorporate all steps of plans sampling in several stages. A discussion about Quality of this approximation and alternatives can be found in [@SSW92], p. 153.

In some cases, sample replication methods (*bootstrap*, *jackknife*) can also be used to estimate variances, as we will see later.

## Bootstrap Method

The method was proposed by @Efron1979, but the version we consider here is the so-called Rao-Wu-Yue Rescaling Bootstrap, which is adequate for stratified multi-stage sampling designs commonly used in household surveys - see @Rao1992. This method is now widely used for variance estimation with complex survey data. To implement this method, you need to follow the sequence of steps outlined below.

Step 1. Select a simple random sample with replacement of size $m_h - 1$ of PSUs in each of the $H$ design strata. Each selected PSU takes with it all the subordinate sampling units and their data. 

Step 2. Repeat Step 1 $R$ times, and denote by $m_{hi}(r)$ the number of times the PSU $i$ of stratum $h$ was selected for the sample in replicate $r$.

Step 3. Calculate the *bootstrap* weight of unit $k$ within PSU $i$ of stratum $h$ as $w_{hik} (r) = w_{hik} \times \frac {m_h}{m_h - 1} \times m_{hi}(r)$.

Step 4. For each replica $r$, calculate an estimate $\widehat \theta_{(r)}$ of the target parameter $theta$ using the *bootstrap* weights $w_{hik} (r)$. 

Step 5. Estimate the variance using:

$$
\widehat V_{B} \left( \widehat \theta \right) = \frac {1} {R} \sum_{r=1}^R \left( \widehat \theta_{(r)} - \tilde \theta \right)^2
$$

where $\tilde \theta = \frac 1 R \sum_{r=1}^R \widehat \theta_{(r)}$ is the average of the replica estimates.

Whenever the original sampling weights $w_{hik}$ receive non-response adjustments or are calibrated, the corresponding non-response adjustments and/or calibration of the basic weights must be repeated for each replica, so that the variance estimates adequately reflect the effects of the calibration and non-response adjusments on the uncertainty of the point estimates.

This method is more computationally costly, but provides good estimates of variance, including for quantiles and other parameters of complex nonlinear forms. It also makes it easier for users who do not have access to software capable of calculating complex variance expressions based on Taylor linearization, etc. The survey package allows you to generate *bootstrap* replicas and also estimate variances using this method.

## Using software to generate valid inferences

In this part, we advocate to using specialized statistical software to generate efficient estimation processes. Those packages support complex survey data analysis by specifying the survey design using appropriate commands or functions.
