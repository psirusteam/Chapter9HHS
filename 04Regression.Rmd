# Regression: modelling survey data

Modelling survey data is a common task among researcher; some of them include the features of the sampling design in computing standard error of the estimated regression parameters. In this section we will deal with the problem of weighting in regression models and present a parsimonious solution. 

## To weight or not to weight? 

We present the pros and cons of including the complex design features in the estimation of regression parameters and their associated standard errors. We present some adjustment to the sampling weights to fit these kind of models (senate sampling weights, normalized sampling weights, Pfeffermann model weights).

## Some inferential approaches to modelling data

When modelling survey data, one should deal with two sources of variability: the one devoted to the complex sampling design and the one that comes from the very model. Combining these sources into a valid set up requires of some advanced methods. We will mention some of them: pseudo likelihood, combined inference.

## Linear models

We present a primer of linear models and estimation of regression coefficients along with their standard errors. Also, this subsection will introduce basic tools to model diagnosis.

## Logistic models

To model the probability of discrete variables, we apply the principles of design-based inference.

## NSO â€“ Practical example

In this subsection, we will share the experience of an NSO in applying models to household survey data, and the results they present in terms of significance of models and relations among variables.
