# Comparisons and association 

Elaborate analyses of household survey data must be adjusted for the complex survey design to account for clustering, stratification, and weighting. This section will introduce the reader on the main methods currently used to compare subgroups and make conclusions based on a valid inferential context. 

## Cross-tabulations

We first examine the relationship between two or more variables by creating contingency tables, which reveal how responses vary across different categories.

## Tests for group comparisons

To determine whether the means of two groups are significantly different we will introduce t-test and contrasts adjusted for the sampling design.

## Tests of Independence

To measure the level of association between categorical variables we present the Rao-Scott correction for the Pearson Chi-squared test of independence.

## Correlation

To conclude on the degree of association between variables, we show the proper approach to include sampling weights and complex sampling design.


## NSO â€“ Practical example

In this part an NSO will share its experiences on dealing with statistical comparisons among groups and how do they present the results in tables.
