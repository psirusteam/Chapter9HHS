# Abstract {-}

Analyzing complex household survey data requires knowing and properly applying the foundations of the design-based inference. The researcher will be faced to a small database that contains specific information that will allow her to make conclusions over the whole population. 

The purpose of any analysis on this kind of datasets is not referred to make conclusions on the sample itself – which in most of the cases is a small subgroup of the population - but to the domains of interest and the whole population. Having that into account, the first step in any analysis plan should be devoted to defining the sampling design based on the selection mechanisms used to draw the final sample and the findings on the field related to nonresponse and lack of coverage. 

The chapter covers three main topics of analysis: descriptive statistics; comparisons and association; and modeling of survey data. On the one hand, we introduce simple descriptive statistics, such as totals, frequencies, means and proportions, quantiles and some graphics; on the other, we delve deeper on complex relationships between the variables of the survey. All these analyses rely on the representativity principle of the design-based inference. This way, the reader will find a strong focus, not only on point estimates, but also on uncertainty measures. The chapter also presents a short discussion on the different approaches that can be used to estimate variances; the best way to visualize the estimates; and NSO practical experiences.
