# Data visualization

In this section we delve deeper on how to present the results of the analysis of household surveys using graphics. This part is important because household surveys estimates are subject to error and the researcher should face this challenge on presenting not only point estimates, but also standard errors. 

## Weighted Histograms

To visualize the distribution of continuous variables, adjusted for survey weights.

## Bar Charts

To display the distribution of categorical variables with standard errors.

## Box Plots

To show the distribution of continuous variables, including measures of central tendency, variability, and outliers, across different groups or strata.

## Scatter Plots

To explore the relationship between two continuous variables, potentially revealing patterns or trends in survey data. 


## Maps

To display the behavior of the interest variable across geographical domains.


## NSO â€“ Practical example

In this subsection we will include the experience of a NSO on displaying information through graphics.
