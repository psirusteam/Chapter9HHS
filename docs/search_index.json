The researcher will be faced to a small database that contains specific information that will allow her to make conclusions over the whole population. The purpose of any analysis on this kind of datasets is not referred to make conclusions on the sample itself – which in most of the cases is a small subgroup of the population - but to the domains of interest and the whole population. Having that into account, the first step in any analysis plan should be devoted to defining the sampling design based on the selection mechanisms used to draw the final sample and the findings on the field related to nonresponse and lack of coverage. The chapter covers three main topics of analysis: descriptive statistics; comparisons and association; and modeling of survey data. On the one hand, we introduce simple descriptive statistics, such as totals, frequencies, means and proportions, quantiles and some graphics; on the other, we delve deeper on complex relationships between the variables of the survey. All these analyses rely on the representativity principle of the design-based inference. This way, the reader will find a strong focus, not only on point estimates, but also on uncertainty measures. The chapter also presents a short discussion on the different approaches that can be used to estimate variances; the best way to visualize the estimates; and NSO practical experiences.

This is even reflected in the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, namely: Principle 3. To facilitate a correct interpretation of the data, the statistical agencies are to present information according to scientific standards on the sources, methods and procedures of the statistics. Principle 4. The statistical agencies are entitled to comment on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. Here we emphasize a particular aspect, aiming to empower users when analysing household survey data. The computer revolution, with the resulting ease of access computers, created favorable conditions for the increased use of statistical data, including those resulting from household sample surveys. Sometimes this data is used for purely descriptive purposes. Other times, however, its use is made for analytical purposes, involving the testing of hypothesis or the construction of models, when the objective is to draw conclusions that are also applicable to populations other than the one from which the sample was extracted. In such cases, standard statistical software may provide biased or misleading results. This chapter’s purpose is to present the relevant models, methods and software to enable users to account for the complex survey design frequently used to conduct household sample surveys when analysing the resulting data. What makes such data special for those who intend to use them for analytical purposes? The answer is that they are obtained through complex sample surveys of finite populations that often involve: stratification, clustering of units of analysis, unequal probabilities of selection, and weighting adjustments to compensate for non-response and/or improve precision. Standard data analysis methods and software typically ignore these aspects, and may produce biased estimates of both the target parameters and the variances of these estimates. In this chapter we analyze the impact of simplifications made when using standard data analysis methods and software, and present the necessary adjustments to these procedures in order to appropriately incorporate the aspects highlighted here into the analysis. In section 9.1, a short discussion on the fundamental principles of the design-based inference is presented, emphasizing that conclusions taken from probability sample surveys should be based on a pair: the point estimate and it associated margin of error (or any related measure). In section 9.2, we begin the journey with simple descriptive statistics: means, ratios, proportions and other typical descriptive parameters. Section 9.3 is devoted to more complex parameters that allow comparisons of the phenomenon of interest between subgroups for continuous and discrete variables. In this section we present standard tests to compare means and measure the degree of association between variables, and also consider the problem of correlation and association. Section 9.4 focuses on modelling survey outcomes. We first involve the reader in an discussion on the role of weighting when estimating regression coefficients. Then, we introduce some proper approaches to estimate complex parameters in linear and logistic regression models. Finally, section 9.5 presents a summary of ideas and tools for survey data visualization showing the best practices for creating graphics and maps in a context where uncertainty measures of estimates are important. Most of the sections in the chapter present national experiences that will guide the reader on how NSOs are dealing with the different stages of the analysis of household survey data. The purpose of this chapter is defining and explaining basic concepts of the design-based paradigm in household surveys to analyze complex household survey data.

In section 9.2, we begin the journey with simple descriptive statistics: means, ratios, proportions and other parameters are part of this discussion. Section 9.3 is devoted to more complex parameters that allow comparisons of the phenomenon of interest between subgroups for continuous and discrete variables. In this section we present standard tests to compare means and measure the degree of association between variables. This section also deals with the problem of correlation and association.
