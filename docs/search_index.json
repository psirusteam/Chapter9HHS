The researcher will be faced to a small database that contains specific information that will allow her to make conclusions over the whole population. The purpose of any analysis on this kind of datasets is not referred to make conclusions on the sample itself – which in most of the cases is a small subgroup of the population - but to the domains of interest and the whole population. Having that into account, the first step in any analysis plan should be devoted to defining the sampling design based on the selection mechanisms used to draw the final sample and the findings on the field related to nonresponse and lack of coverage. The chapter covers three main topics of analysis: descriptive statistics; comparisons and association; and modeling of survey data. On the one hand, we introduce simple descriptive statistics, such as totals, frequencies, means and proportions, quantiles and some graphics; on the other, we delve deeper on complex relationships between the variables of the survey. All these analyses rely on the representativity principle of the design-based inference. This way, the reader will find a strong focus, not only on point estimates, but also on uncertainty measures. The chapter also presents a short discussion on the different approaches that can be used to estimate variances; the best way to visualize the estimates; and NSO practical experiences.

In section 9.1, a short discussion on the fundamental principles of the design-based inference is presented, emphasizing that conclusions taken from this kind of surveys should be based on a pair: the point estimate and it associated margin of error (or any related measure). In section 9.2, we begin the journey with simple descriptive statistics: means, ratios, proportions and other parameters are part of this discussion. Section 9.3 is devoted to more complex parameters that allow comparisons of the phenomenon of interest between subgroups for continuous and discrete variables. In this section we present standard tests to compare means and measure the degree of association between variables. This section also deals with the problem of correlation and association. Section 9.4 focuses on modelling survey outcomes. We first involve the reader in an discussion on the role of weighting when estimating regression coefficients. Then, we introduce some proper approaches to estimate complex parameters in linear and logistic regression models. Finally, section 9.5 presents a summary on survey data visualization showing the best practices for creating graphics and maps in a context where uncertainty measures of estimates are important. Most of the sections in the chapter present national experiences that will guide the reader on how currently NSOs are dealing with the different stages of the analysis of household survey data.

We must make sure that PSU, strata, and weights are available in the database. When not available, the database should contain replicate weights, or the researcher should have a valid expression to compute variance estimates. Defining the sample design is crucial for design-based inference and analysis, ensuring accuracy, precision, and consistency. A well-defined survey design facilitates statistical analysis, supports effective data interpretation, and enables meaningful insights into complex phenomena.

In this subsection we will present some approaches for variance estimation: exact and approximate formulas (ultimate cluster) for variances of totals; and Taylor linearization for means, ratios and other parameters. We also introduce replication methods and generalized variance functions, which are essential in the cases when PSU or strata are missing from the database.
