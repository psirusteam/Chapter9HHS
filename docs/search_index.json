The researcher will be faced to a small database that contains specific information that will allow her to make conclusions over the whole population. The purpose of any analysis on this kind of datasets is not referred to make conclusions on the sample itself – which in most of the cases is a small subgroup of the population - but to the domains of interest and the whole population. Having that into account, the first step in any analysis plan should be devoted to defining the sampling design based on the selection mechanisms used to draw the final sample and the findings on the field related to nonresponse and lack of coverage. The chapter covers three main topics of analysis: descriptive statistics; comparisons and association; and modeling of survey data. On the one hand, we introduce simple descriptive statistics, such as totals, frequencies, means and proportions, quantiles and some graphics; on the other, we delve deeper on complex relationships between the variables of the survey. All these analyses rely on the representativity principle of the design-based inference. This way, the reader will find a strong focus, not only on point estimates, but also on uncertainty measures. The chapter also presents a short discussion on the different approaches that can be used to estimate variances; the best way to visualize the estimates; and NSO practical experiences.

Combining these sources into a valid set up requires of some advanced methods. We will mention some of them: pseudo likelihood, combined inference. "],["linear-models.html", "1.3 Linear models", " 1.3 Linear models 1.3.1 Basic Definitions As noted by Heeringa, West, and Berglund (2017), the first authors to empirically discuss the impact of complex sampling designs on regression model inferences were Kish and Frankel (1974). Later, Fuller (1975) developed a variance estimator for regression model parameters based on Taylor linearization with unequal weighting of observations under stratified and two-stage sampling designs. As is well known, the use of regression model theory requires certain statistical assumptions to be met, which can sometimes be challenging to verify in practice. In this regard, Shah, Holt, and Folsom (1977) discuss some aspects related to the violation of these assumptions and provide appropriate methods for making inferences about the estimated parameters of linear regression models using survey data. Similarly, Binder (1983) obtained the sampling distributions of estimators for regression parameters in finite populations and related variance estimators in the context of complex samples. Skinner, Holt, and Smith (1989) studied the properties of variance estimators for regression coefficients under complex sample designs. Later, Fuller (2002) provided a summary of estimation methods for regression models containing information related to complex samples. Finally, Pfeffermann (2011) discussed various approaches to fitting linear regression models to complex survey data, presenting empirical support for the use of the “q-weighted” method, which is recommended in this document. A simple linear regression model is defined as \\(y=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x+\\varepsilon\\), where \\(y\\) represents the dependent variable, \\(x\\) is the independent variable, and \\(\\beta_{0}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) are the model parameters. The variable \\(\\varepsilon\\) is known as the random error of the model and is defined as \\(\\varepsilon=y-\\hat{y}=y-\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x\\). Generalizing the previous model, multiple linear regression models are defined by allowing the dependent variable to interact with more than two variables, as presented below: \\[ y = \\boldsymbol{x}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\varepsilon = \\sum_{j=0}^{p}\\beta_{j}x_{j}+\\varepsilon = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{p}x_{p}+\\varepsilon \\] Another way to write the multiple regression model is: \\[ y_{i} = x_{i}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+\\varepsilon_{i} \\] Where, \\(x_{i}=\\left[1\\,x_{1i}\\,\\ldots\\,x_{pi}\\right]\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{T}=\\left[\\beta_{0}\\,\\,\\beta_{1}\\,\\,\\ldots\\,\\,\\beta_{p}\\right]\\). The subscript \\(i\\) refers to the sample element or respondent in the dataset. Heeringa, West, and Berglund (2017) present some considerations for regression models, which are described below: \\(E\\left(\\varepsilon_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\right)=0\\), meaning that the expected value of the residuals conditioned on the covariates is zero. \\(Var\\left(\\varepsilon_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\right)=\\sigma_{y,x}^{2}\\) (homogeneity of variance), meaning that the variance of the residuals conditioned on the covariates is constant. \\(\\varepsilon_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\sim N\\left(0,\\,\\sigma_{y,x}^{2}\\right)\\) (normality of errors), meaning that the residuals conditioned on the covariates follow a normal distribution. This property also extends to the response variable \\(y_{i}\\). \\(cov\\left(\\varepsilon_{i},\\,\\varepsilon_{j}\\mid x_{i},x_{j}\\right)\\) (independence of residuals), meaning that the residuals in different observed units are not correlated with the values given by their predictor variables. Once the linear regression model and its assumptions are defined, it can be deduced that the best unbiased linear estimator is defined as the expected value of the dependent variable conditioned on the independent variables \\(x\\), as: \\[ E\\left(y\\mid x\\right)=\\hat{\\beta}_{0}+\\hat{\\beta_{1}}x_{1}+\\hat{\\beta}_{2}x_{2}+\\cdots+\\hat{\\beta}_{p}x_{p} \\] \\[ \\hat{y} = E\\left(y\\mid x\\right) = E\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\right)+E\\left(\\varepsilon\\right) = \\boldsymbol{x}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}+0 = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_{p}x_{p} \\] Additionally, \\[ var\\left(y_{i}\\mid x_{i}\\right) = \\sigma_{y,x}^{2} \\] It is also established that: \\[ cov\\left(y_{i},y_{j}\\mid x_{i},x_{j}\\right) = 0 \\] Thus, the response variable has the following distribution: \\[ y_{i} \\sim N\\left(x_{i}\\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\sigma_{y,x}^{2}\\right) \\] 1.3.2 Estimation of Parameters in a Regression Model with Complex Samples Once the assumptions of the model and the distributional characteristics of the errors are established, the next step is the process of parameter estimation. As an illustrative and introductory example, if instead of observing a sample of size \\(n\\) from the \\(N\\) elements of the population, a complete census had been conducted, the finite population regression parameter \\(\\beta_{1}\\) could be calculated as follows: \\[ \\beta_{1} = \\frac{{ \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(X_{i}-\\bar{X}\\right)\\left(Y_{i}-\\bar{Y}\\right)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(X_{i}-\\bar{X}\\right)^{2}} \\] Now, when estimating the parameters of a linear regression model considering that the observed information comes from surveys with complex samples, the standard approach to estimating regression coefficients and their standard errors is altered. The main reason for this change is that data collected through a complex survey generally does not have an identical distribution, and the assumption of independence cannot be maintained since the sample design is constructed with dependencies (as most complex designs include stratification, clustering, unequal selection probabilities, etc.). In this context, when fitting regression models with such datasets, using conventional estimators derived from traditional methods (such as maximum likelihood, for example) will induce bias because these methods assume the data are independently and identically distributed and come from a specific probability distribution (binomial, Poisson, exponential, normal, etc.). Instead, according to Wolter (2007), robust non-parametric methods based on Taylor linearization or variance estimation methods using replication (Jackknife, bootstrapping, etc.) are used to eliminate bias by including the sampling design in the analyses. For illustrative purposes, the estimation of the parameter \\(\\beta_{1}\\) and its variance for a simple linear regression will be shown. The extension to multiple regression parameter estimation is algebraically complex and beyond the scope of this book.
