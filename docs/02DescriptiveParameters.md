# Descriptive parameters

When analyzing complex survey data, several descriptive parameters are meaningful and important. For example: poverty and unemployment rates are simple parameters that allow decision-making for governments; also, income distribution can be used to monitor inequality along time. 

## Frequencies

Considering survey weights assigned to each respondent helps provide estimates that are representative of the target population.

## Means, proportions, and ratios

These measures of central tendency provide insights into the average or typical response within the data.
 
## Percentiles and inequality measures

For continuous data, these measures divide the data into intervals, indicating the proportion of data points below a certain value, and are particularly useful for understanding distributions and identifying outliers. Also, the section will cover the estimation of the Gini inequality index. 

## NSO â€“ Practical example

In this subsection a NSO will share how they do disseminate its results on basic descriptive statistics, how they publish the resulting tables and how do they deal with the suppression of estimates that do not reach expected quality.
