# Tables

Tables are a fundamental tool for disseminating statistics from household survey data. They serve to organize and present numerical results efficiently, minimizing the need for lengthy text descriptions. When well-designed, tables enhance clarity and make it easier for users and wider audiences to interpret survey results. It is therefore important to discuss some core principles and ideas to the preparation and production of tables with survey results.

Before we enter detailed discussions, it is important to distinguish three main types of tables that can be used for presenting the results of a survey:

- **Presentation Tables**: These tables are designed to highlight key findings and are often included in reports or presentations. They are concise and focus on results that support specific messages or conclusions.
- **Reference Tables**: These tables provide comprehensive details and are aimed at users who need in-depth information. They are typically larger, covering a wide range of variables and subgroups.
- **Long Tables**: These tables are structured for use in databases or data systems. They contain raw or minimally processed data, organized for further analysis or integration with other datasets.

Regardless of the type of table, certain principles should guide their design to ensure they are effective and user-friendly. According to Miller (2004) (XXXXXXXX citation needed), two fundamental principles should always be considered:

-   **Principle 1.** Make it easy for your reader to find and understand the numbers presented in your tables, using clear and concise labels for rows and columns, highlighting key results, and avoiding excessive detail that might overwhelm the reader.
-   **Principle 2.** Draw the layout and labels of the table in a simple and direct way, helping to focus attention on the results you want to show, using logical and intuitive ordering of rows and columns, grouping related variables or categories together and minimizing clutter by avoiding unnecessary lines, colors, or decorations.

## Presentation tables

The primary goal of presentation tables is to communicate key results clearly and effectively. They are designed to support the accompanying text by organizing data in a way that emphasizes significant patterns, trends, or stories revealed by the survey. These tables should help readers quickly grasp the main findings without being overwhelmed by excessive detail. These are generally small tables, used to highlight certain key results obtained from the survey, to be presented in press releases, executive summaries, scientific articles or reports, or on landing web pages that showcase survey outputs. They are not expected to provide all results on a topic, but rather to highlight key results that should draw the attention of a reader to some of the main stories the data have produced.

In presentation tables, the data should be presented concisely, and organized to support the text with the analysis of the corresponding data. They should be designed in such a way to help readers learn about the key results on the topic provided by the survey. Short, well-designed and formatted tables can provide a lot of information that readers can absorb quickly. This applies to tables published in any vehicle: reports, press releases, articles, electronic publications or websites. The example below illustrates the idea.

Presentation tables should have rows (and possibly columns) sorted in a way that helps the reader perceive patterns, such as high or low figures. Such tables will often sacrifice detail in exchange for readability and understanding. Numbers should be presented with no more than 3 or 4 digits altoghether. If they area population counts, use thousands. If the figures are percentages, use no more than a single decimal digit, or even present only percentages rounded to the nearest integer, if the precision of the estimates do not warrant providing decimals (e.g. margins of error larger than 1%).

### Example of presentation table and corresponding text - include in a box.

Below is an example of a presentation table designed to highlight key findings on gender representation among different managerial levels and age groups. The accompanying text contextualizes the data, emphasizing the underrepresentation of women in managerial roles across all ages.

Among middle and senior managers, women are outnumbered at all ages. The underrepresentation of women was observed in all age groups. Relative to their share among non-managers, women were outnumbered among middle and senior managers. In all age groups, women accounted for about 4 in 10 middle managers and 3 in 10 senior managers.

Table 2 - Share of women (%) by age group and occupation

|   Age group    | Non-managers | Middle managers | Senior managers |
|:--------------:|:------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| 25 to 34 years |     44.6     |      40.3       |      28.4       |
| 35 to 44 years |     45.7     |      38.7       |      31.3       |
| 45 to 54 years |     48.3     |      40.5       |      31.7       |

Note: The category "women" includes women, as well as some non-binary people. Source: Statistics Canada, Census of Population, 2021. <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/36-28-0001/2024010/article/00005-eng.htm>

This table concisely presents the percentage of women in different occupational categories (non-managers, middle managers, and senior managers) across three age groups. It highlights how a well-designed presentation table can summarize key findings and complement textual analysis. By organizing data clearly and emphasizing critical patterns, such tables enhance the readability and impact of survey results.


## Reference tables

Reference tables are longer tables designed to present more comprehensive sets of results from statistical studies. These tables are typically included in reports to provide detailed information, but they should remain manageable in size. A good rule of thumb is to limit them to a maximum of 200 rows and 12 columns. Larger tables should be considered for dissemination as database-like tables, accessible via downloads or interactive websites.

Reference tables will typically take core classification, domain definition or *explanatory* variables to define the rows, and have the *outcome* classification or output variables define the columns. In both directions, sorting should typically be such that it is easier for the readers to locate the data that they are most interested in, either using alphabetic or well known classifications. This tables have in many cases been replaced by access to interactive databases that allow the interested user to obtain the tables they want from a website.

Tables (of all types) should be *self-sustaining*. The idea is that each table should have the necessary metadata, so that if copied from one location to another it still makes sense. If you can get your tables to be *self-sustaining*, they will be easier to understand correctly, either in or out of the original context.

The following are the essential components of a well-designed table:

* The title (and optional subtitle) of a table must provide a clear and precise indication of the data that will be presented in the table. These elements, combined, must answer the questions about what, where and when regarding the data to be presented inside the table. Be concise and avoid using verbs.
* Column header elements should identify the data that is displayed in each column of the table. They must also provide much of the relevant metadata: unit of measurement, time period, geographical area, etc.
* Row Headers and Stub elements, provided as the first column in the table, should identify the data that is displayed in each row of the table.
* Source of the data must always be provided at the bottom of the table, and must indicate the organization responsible and the name of the survey or study that produced the results contained in the table. The omission of the citation of the source prevents the reader from seeking more information about the data presented, and should be avoided.
* Notes are optional, but they can be used to provide additional details about the data as needed to understand and use it correctly. Avoid using long texts, which if needed, would be better placed in a document that is then cited in the Notes section. If there is more than one Note, number sequentially, and use the numbers to indicate the corresponding calls inside the table. Make sure that the calls to Notes are sufficiently distinct from the actual figures / numbers inside te table to avoid confusion.
* Data is the most important piece of information that the user expects to get from the table. Therefore, it is essential to present them in a way that is easy to extract the relevant information. For some tables, depending on the message you want to convey, it may be easier to search for information by rows or columns. This should be the most important consideration when deciding whether to present the table in portrait or landscape orientation. Dividing lines, dotted lines, shading, and even spacing can be helpful in guiding the reader to read the table in the 'right' direction.

When designing tables to present statistical data, ensuring clarity and consistency is crucial. Start by maintaining uniform spacing across columns to enhance readability, while avoiding unnecessary text or excessive width that can distract from the data. Time series data should always be organized in chronological order, preferably ascending for reference tables, to provide a clear and logical progression of information. Categorize data using standard classifications to facilitate understanding and comparison across different datasets.

The arrangement of rows and columns should follow a clear and logical order, with numerical data aligned to the right to ensure decimal points are neatly aligned. Decimal places should be limited to what is necessary for precision, and rounding should aim for 3-4 significant digits to simplify the data while preserving its integrity. Avoid blank cells, which can cause confusion; instead, use appropriate symbols to indicate missing or "not applicable" values, ensuring the table remains informative and complete.

Finally, these practices collectively improve the usability of the table, making it easier for readers to analyze and interpret the data. By adhering to these guidelines, you create a presentation that is both professional and accessible, promoting effective communication of statistical insights.

The recommendations provided here to reference tables should also apply to longer tables provided as databases, but these can have additional resources if they are embedded on websites. For example, there may be support for users to sort tables using the values in each column, which would be useful for large tables where the user may be looking for the higher (or lower) values in a given column.


## Low-Quality Estimates


National Statistical Offices routinely produce descriptive statistics, such as totals, averages, proportions, and ratios, based on survey data. These statistics provide valuable insights into key characteristics of the population, such as income levels, employment rates, or access to education. To ensure this information reaches a wide audience, NSOs often use a variety of dissemination channels, including:

- **Public Reports**: Comprehensive reports summarizing key findings from household surveys.
- **Online Platforms**: Interactive data visualization tools and downloadable datasets on official websites.
- **Press Releases**: Brief summaries of major findings designed to capture public and media attention.

These dissemination efforts aim to make the data understandable and actionable for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. When publishing tables of results, NSOs strive for clarity and usability. Tables are typically organized to highlight trends, comparisons, and distributions of key variables. Common features of published tables include:

- **Aggregated Data**: Grouping data by categories like age, gender, region, or socioeconomic status.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Including measures of uncertainty to provide context for the estimates.
- **Metadata**: Offering detailed explanations of the data collection methods, definitions, and limitations.

By presenting data in a user-friendly format, NSOs ensure their publications are accessible to a diverse audience.

Not all estimates derived from survey data meet the necessary quality standards for publication. Estimates may be suppressed if they are based on small sample sizes, have high variance, or are otherwise unreliable. NSOs use established criteria to determine when suppression is necessary, ensuring that the released data maintains its credibility. To address this issue we can use the following approaches:

1. **Quality Thresholds**: NSOs set predefined thresholds for measures like the coefficient of variation (CV) or standard errors.
2. **Flagging and Suppression**: Estimates that fall below these thresholds are either flagged with warnings about their reliability or omitted entirely from published tables.
3. **Transparency**: NSOs provide clear documentation explaining why certain estimates are suppressed, maintaining transparency and trust.
