# Introduction {-}

The purpose of this chapter is defining and explaining basic concepts of the design-based paradigm in household surveys to analyze complex household survey data. In section 9.1, a short discussion on the fundamental principles of the design-based inference is presented, emphasizing that conclusions taken from this kind of surveys should be based on a pair: the point estimate and it associated margin of error (or any related measure). In section 9.2, we begin the journey with simple descriptive statistics: means, ratios, proportions and other parameters are part of this discussion. Section 9.3 is devoted to more complex parameters that allow comparisons of the phenomenon of interest between subgroups for continuous and discrete variables. In this section we present standard tests to compare means and measure the degree of association between variables. This section also deals with the problem of correlation and association. Section 9.4 focuses on modelling survey outcomes. We first involve the reader in an discussion on the role of weighting when estimating regression coefficients. Then, we introduce some proper approaches to estimate complex parameters in linear and logistic regression models. Finally, section 9.5 presents a summary on survey data visualization showing the best practices for creating graphics and maps in a context where uncertainty measures of estimates are important. 

Most of the sections in the chapter present national experiences that will guide the reader on how currently NSOs are dealing with the different stages of the analysis of household survey data.
